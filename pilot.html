  <p>(disclaimer: this was part of my old blog and I am keeping it up in an archived state)</p>
  <h1>What&#x27;s all the fuss about?</h1>
  <h2>The Why</h2>
  <p>I have been meaning to start a blog for the last 2-3 years now.
    Always hesitated because of many reasons. But the two main deterrents were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Iâ€™ll post when I have some perfect quality content</li>
    <li>What if no one reads it?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And unsurprisingly, both these issues were related to my belief in my abilities. Both these reasons point
    to the same fear but they come through different alleys.</p>
  <p>The first one is a classic problem that I face before working on anything.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Get an idea </li>
    <li>Fall in love with it </li>
    <li>Envision the execution </li>
    <li>Realize itâ€™s not good enough </li>
    <li>Gradually abandon the idea</li>
    <li>GOTO Step 1</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I do this with poems, blogs, code, songs, any creative endeavor basically. The envision part of the cycle
    does allow me to let my imagination run wild which is a very good thing. But the persistent and pragmatic
    follow through that is required makes me doubt myself a lot. The first sign of troubling struggle can be a
    major downer sometimes. That doesnâ€™t mean that I donâ€™t get anything done ever. There are times when I can
    get a lot of work done (when Iâ€™m in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">zone</a>).
    But I always found a blog to be a bigger and a much thorough commitment.</p>
  <p>The second reason, even though it sounds a little childish, is a bummer because I do want that human
    connection. I want to share what I create with everyone, get their feedback and connect.</p>
  <p>I think both these reasons point to one thing and that is the realization that I may not be as good as I
    want to be. There is nothing wrong with the sentiment in itself as it makes us realize our shortcomings. But
    if youâ€™re not in a good place it can make you feel worthless and take you to a really dark place. I have
    been there many times before and my advice to myself (and maybe you) is to break down tasks and <em>bear the
      burden of only one day at a time</em>. Whenever I have successfully done that, I donâ€™t think about the
    mythical golden destination and I end up working on the task at hand (I do fall prey to the dark patterns
    again many times though, but when that happens, <strong>you should talk to someone</strong>).</p>
  <p>So coming to the â€˜whyâ€™ of writing this blog, I just felt like sharing some of my thoughts. With myself and
    hopefully with a few others.
    It has always been a hurdle to start, so I have decided to break a post into logical parts and write it in
    bursts. I will write/prune/proofread in those bursts so that the burden of the end goal does not weigh heavy
    on me (advice that sounds pretty good for other things too, now that I write it).</p>
  <p>And the focus of collecting these thoughts for myself seems to have allayed the fears of the second reason
    for now.</p>
  <h2>The What</h2>
  <p>I think I am going to blog about two broad logical categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tech</strong>: Anything that I am learning, reading, or fascinated about. Less tutorial-y, more
      story form.</li>
    <li><strong>General Musings</strong>: I get a lot of random thoughts, this will be the place for that. I
      donâ€™t know who the audience for that is, but thatâ€™s okay I think.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Wonâ€™t be posting any poems here because I post them on Instagram, at least the short ones, and Iâ€™m fine
    with that right now.
    Iâ€™ll also leave a link to a song at the end of every post (98% chances of being unrelated to the post)
    because I love sharing music ðŸ™‚</p>
