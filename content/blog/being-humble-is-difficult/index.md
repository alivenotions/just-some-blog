* Humblebrag
* Being aware of being humble. Humility does not just mean deflecting praise or playing down one's own achievements. That is generally a sign of relatively low self-belief (or a way to pander for more validation). It is very common to suffer from a low self-belief, with the prevalance of Imposter Syndrome and such. 
**Read about Imposter syndrome, watch THAT video**
* Humility also comes down to being empathetic to others. And being empathetic is SO difficult in itself.
