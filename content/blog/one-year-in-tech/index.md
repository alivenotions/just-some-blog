This post is about certain things that I have learnt and realised over the past one year working professionaly right after college. (it's actually 1.5 years but that doesn't sound as cool ðŸ˜…)

These things are sort of reminders for the future-me because it is very easy to not follow them. This is a fairly long article, but then again, a year is a long time too.
So without further ado!

## Be part of good communities

## Be interested in the why

This will also encourage you to not dismiss things quickly as you'll be eager to know the reasoning behind things.

## Try to learn across the stack

Empathy

## Shoot for heavier stuff

Read things that you don't 100% get. This also helps you to not harp on memorizing things.

## Have your own side gig

## It's okay to feel bad on some days

## Sleep

## Care and humility
Care for the code that you write
And realize that code is just part of the puzzle.

## Go where your curiosity takes you

Everyone has an opinion about what you should do or which path to follow and most of these opinions should be respected. Another factor that can sway someone's decision is monetary and it is a huge one. But that should not deter you from following your curiosity. Sometimes satiating that knowledge thirst is so much more important that it doesn't matter if no one is paying you. **[Rething this point and wordings]**

## Persistence > Everything else

This is something that I had to learn the hard way. For the first 3-4 months of my career I would try to learn in different verticals. Whatever sounded cool that day, I would try my hand in that. Buy a course, watch a youtube playlist etc. While there's nothing bad in that, the pain is that such a practice doesn't register in memory. I barely remember any python despite buying two courses and doing 80% of one. I am starting to forget the details of the ML course that I did. The core reasoning for this is the lack of persistence. Learning less but being persistent in what you're learning is infinitely better than putting in 10 hours a day on different things every day.
