This post is about certain things that I have learnt and realised over the past year and a half working professionaly right after college.

These things are sort of reminders for the future-me because it is very easy to not follow them, so I am talking to myself as much as the general audience with this post. This is a fairly long article, but then again, a year is a long time too.
So without further ado!

## Be part of good communities

Participating in communities is a huge motivation to any sort of work that you do. The community helps you when you stumble, brainstorms ideas, and in general makes your work very much a social activity. One of the interesting things that I have personally noticed is that when you don't feel like getting something done, involving yourself in discussions (just by reading them too) can be a huge push to start trying out things yourself. I have been part of a few communities over the last year. I have been a listener for most of the part and will be looking to contribute more and in different ways.

## Be interested in the why

Knowing things is good but trying to understand the reasoning for the concept can be more fulfilling many times. It helps you to see why something was created or developed and how it fits in the larger picture. It also makes you realise that a lot of what you learn is readily transferable to various things. And that can enable you to concentrate on building solutions rather than keep worrying about the tools. Another advantage of this that I have picked up is that it makes being empathetic towards a library's (or anybody's) decision easier. Being interested in why something was done a way it was will encourage you to not dismiss things quickly as you'll be eager to know the reasoning behind things.

## Try to learn across the stack

This does not mean that you try to learn EVERYTHING that is possibly there in the world. I think that is impossible. This is not even implying that you try to learn everything about your project that you're currently working on at work. But I think it is highly beneficial to understand how different moving parts of your application interact with each other and how information is passed from one module to another. Not only does this make having a conversation with different teams easier and more holistic, it also gives you immense empathy towards everyone who's working in your team because you realize the importance of their work.

## Shoot for heavier stuff

Read things that you don't 100% get. Or things that are currently beyond your skill level. You may understand only 50% of it or maybe even less but it feeds your curiosity and makes you struggle through the content. You will do your own research, look for things, ask your own original questions. This is also a humbling exercise because you will realise that there are things that you don't understand and have to work towards it. But there is a fine line between that excited feeling and a feeling that says that you suck. Whenever you're going to read/learn heavier stuff, consider it a judgement-free zone. Know that it is okay to stop at anytime and that if you takeaway even one thing from the whole exercise, then that's a win!
This is probably the most personal point in this whole article and it may not work for most of you.

## Have your own side gig

The biggest reality hit you get going from college to a job is the realization that a lot of work is not that fun always. You end up doing a lot of boring stuff, or at times just doing random things or not being assigned any work many times. A lot of my friends who started working also faced this. This can start getting on your nerves, especially if you're not that mature in this space. I have found that having your own thing off-hours is absolutely crucial to a healthy mental state. This doesn't necessarily mean just coding after work. You can indulge in your hobbies, learn something new etc. Your office work does not define who you are but it is still a huge chunk of your day. The kick of it is that it is unstable and can change anytime. But doing your own thing is in your control and you choose what brings you satisfaction.

## It's okay to feel bad on some days

There have been many times when I have felt like shit for not being as productive as I would have liked to be. And I think many people feel so from time to time. I want to tell you that it is completely natural to feel so. Go out, do what you like. Please go easy on yourself. People learn and improve over a period of time but we generally are unable to assess such a progress which makes us think less of ourselves. Just breathe and come back to the problem after a day or two.
If you feel that such a low bad feeling is persisting over time, PLEASE go and talk to someone and seek out help. Depression is a real thing.

## Sleep

This one is probably something that requires major discipline because even relatively good intentions hamper sleep. The temptaion of working on something and being productive also makes us feel that we should stay up and continue working. I used to stay up a lot in college and after a point I realised that I just felt tired a lot all the time. I wasn't at my 100% anytime.

## Care and humility
Care for the code that you write
And realize that code is just part of the puzzle.

## Go where your curiosity takes you

Everyone has an opinion about what you should do or which path to follow and most of these opinions should be respected. Another factor that can sway someone's decision is monetary and it is a huge one. But that should not deter you from following your curiosity. Sometimes satiating that knowledge thirst is so much more important that it doesn't matter if no one is paying you. **[Rethink this point and wordings]**

## Persistence > Everything else

This is something that I had to learn the hard way. For the first 3-4 months of my career I would try to learn in different verticals. Whatever sounded cool that day, I would try my hand in that. Buy a course, watch a youtube playlist etc. While there's nothing bad in that, the pain is that such a practice doesn't register in memory. I barely remember any python despite buying two courses and doing 80% of one. I am starting to forget the details of the ML course that I did. The core reasoning for this is the lack of persistence. Learning less but being persistent in what you're learning is infinitely better than putting in 10 hours a day on different things every day.
